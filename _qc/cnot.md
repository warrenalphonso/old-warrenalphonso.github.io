title: The Mystery of the CNOT gate 
---

We can think of the CNOT gates also as a XOR gate: $\text{CNOT} \ket{A, B} = \ket{A, B \oplus A}$. 
- in [QCFTVC](https://quantum.country/qcvc), it turns out CNOT on $CNOT \ket{+ -} = \ket{- -}$
- turns out there are a bunch of weird properties as discussed [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate)
