# Why does Quantum Computing Matter? 

Quantum computers are ony important if they can efficiently solve problems a 
classical computer can't. All (current) known advantages of QC occur because of
these 3 quantum mechanical effects {% annotate The Potential Impact of Quantum 
Computer on Society. Ronald de Wolf. 2017. %}:  

1. Superposition: allows us to be in many classical states "at the same time" 
where each state has a certain amplitude 
2. Interference: lets us manipulate superpositions to cancel states we dont' 
want 
3. Entanglement: allows different parts of a quantum computer or even different 
quantum computers to be correlated in ways not possible classically (how are 
they not possible?) 

Because of how hard it is to come up with quantum algorithms, I think an 
important benefit of quantum computing will be the new tools of thought we'll 
build to help us understand it: "Just as we have learned to *think physically 
about computation*, we can also learn to *think computationall about physics*.

## Cryptography 

RSA is based on the hardness of factoring large numbers, but Shor's algorithm 
can factor in time polynomial in $\log N$. 

### New Cryptographic Systems 

There are two main alternatives: 

1. Post-quantum cryptography: 

## Simulation 

Quantum simulation is useful not only for its obvious applications but also 
because it offers a general method to obtain insight into other quantum 
algorithms. For example, Grover's can be viewed as the solution to a problem 
of quantum simulation (explained in Section 6.2 of NC).

## NP-Complete Problems 

We **can't** use quantum parallelism to serach all solutions at once for 
NP-Complete probems (proved in 6.6 NC).
