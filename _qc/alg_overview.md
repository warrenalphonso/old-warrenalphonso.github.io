"This seems innocuous, almost like a mathematical accident. Still, I draw your attention to it because this type of cancellation or reinforcement is crucial in many algorithms for quantum computers. Without getting into details, the rough way many such algorithms work is to first use Hadamard gates to “spread out” in quantum states ... (or many-qubit analogs), i.e., in superpositions of multiple computational basis states. At the end of the algorithm they use clever patterns of cancellation and reinforcement to bring things back together again into one (or possibly a few, in the many-qubit case) computational basis state, containing the desired answer." - QCFTVC


Get my notes on quantum algorithms from Notion - read the arxiv paper they're on. 

- For each gate, do a Bloch sphere, outer product notation, rotation 
decomposition, matrix form, etc.
- Make sure I cover each of the basic algorithms in NC Ch1 and decal.
