title: The Bloch Sphere

- Understanding the Bloch sphere. 
    - Look at the diagram on p19 of NC: I don't think this is $H$ on $\ket{+}$...
    - How do we derive the rotation of a unitary matrix? Check out NC p20. I don't think NC is correct when it says Hadamard is "just a rotation of the sphere about the $y$-axis by $90^{\circ}$, followed by a rotation about the $x$-axis by $180^{\circ}$" because the Q-CTRL animation doesn't look like that. 
    - What does the matrix form of $H^{\otimes n}$ look like?
