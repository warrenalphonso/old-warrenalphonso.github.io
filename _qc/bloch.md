title: The Bloch Sphere
---

- Understanding the Bloch sphere. 
    - Look at the diagram on p19 of NC: I don't think this is $H$ on $\ket{+}$...
    - How do we derive the rotation of a unitary matrix? Check out NC p20. I don't think NC is correct when it says Hadamard is "just a rotation of the sphere about the $y$-axis by $90^{\circ}$, followed by a rotation about the $x$-axis by $180^{\circ}$" because the Q-CTRL animation doesn't look like that. 
    - What does the matrix form of $H^{\otimes n}$ look like?
    - [These slides](http://www.vcpc.univie.ac.at/~ian/hotlist/qc/talks/bloch-sphere-rotations.pdf) will be super useful. The slide titled "Arbitrary Unitary Operator" is about how any unitary gate can be written as a rotation about some real three-dimensional unit vector. I wonder if we get this same vector when we break down a rotation into $X, Y, Z$ rotation matrices.
