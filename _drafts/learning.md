# On Learning 

This is a reminder to myself of how I should structure my learning. 

## Reading list 

- Nielsen's [guide](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics) to spaced repetition for math 
- Nielsen's [essay](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) on tools for thought
- [SuperMemo wiki](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru)
- [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com)
- Alan Kay's [recommended reading](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp) - look at "Learning and Creativity" section
- [Guide to Anki for math](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/43mf83/guide_how_to_anki_maths_the_right_way/)
- [20 rules for learning](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules)


## Ideas 

What's wrong with Anki? Why don't I use it? Would it be easier to just make my own that fixes these problems. Problems that I have with Anki: 
- Making cards is annoying because it takes a long time, I don't know what to put on it, and I don't know how atomic to make cards. 
    - Well if I want to remember something for a long time, clearly it will require some work and planning ahead. Nielsen says err toward making cards too atomic so there aren't parts in a card you gloss over. 
- Latex is weird. I don't know how to do QC ket notation, etc. 
    - Use MathJax because it works better with Anki apparently. Still not sure how to incorporate QC notation.
