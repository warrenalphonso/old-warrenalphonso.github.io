# On Learning 

This is a reminder to myself of how I should structure my learning. This doesn't mean I'm allowed to write something dull with the obvious stuff for the sake of writing a blog post. What surprising things can I discover about learning? I should write in a way that the obvious basics *are* obvious after reading the surprising things. Dig! Work fast but remember that this will take months to finish. That's good because then I'll be conditioned to look for more material in everything I read. 

Read the websites first and write a post as short as possible that summarizes everything. Use the websites in "On Writing" to figure out how to write it. I really want this to be as condensed as possible because I know there's a lot I'll need to add in terms of examples and more information from the books. 

## Reading list 

- Nielsen's [guide](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics) to spaced repetition for math 
- Nielsen's [essay](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) on tools for thought
- [SuperMemo wiki](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru)
- Alan Kay's [recommended reading](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp) - look at "Learning and Creativity" section
- [Guide to Anki for math](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/43mf83/guide_how_to_anki_maths_the_right_way/)
- *Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn* by Richard Hamming
- Tim Ferriss' [guide to reading faster](https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/)
- Farnam Street's [guide to reading better](https://fs.blog/reading/)
- *Moonwalking with Einstein* by Joshua Foer 
- *How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading* by Mortimer Adler and Charles van Doren
- *Understanding Media* by Marshall McLuhan after I finish everything else. Mostly to see if, as Nielsen suspects, our methods of learning haven't evolved with the new media by which we learn. I can even look into whether the common ways we read are remnants of a way of consuming some older media.

## Ideas 

What's wrong with Anki? Why don't I use it? Would it be easier to just make my own that fixes these problems. Problems that I have with Anki: 
- Making cards is annoying because it takes a long time, I don't know what to put on it, and I don't know how atomic to make cards. 
    - Well if I want to remember something for a long time, clearly it will require some work and planning ahead. Nielsen says err toward making cards too atomic so there aren't parts in a card you gloss over. 
- Latex is weird. I don't know how to do QC ket notation, etc. 
    - Use MathJax because it works better with Anki apparently. Still not sure how to incorporate QC notation. 

## Notes 

### 20 rules of formulating knowledge by Piotr Wozniak 

Speed of learning depends on how you formulate the material. Optimizing the latter means you'll learn faster. Keep in mind the following are arranged in order of importance: those listed first are most often violated and bring the most benefit. 

1. **Do not learn if you do not understand.** Before you put anything in some spaced repetition system, make sure you understand what it means. Continuously check for comprehension. 

2. **Learn before you memorize.** Build a picture of the whole of what you're trying to learn. Learning time is reduced greatly when every piece fits one cohesive structure. One *single* piece that doesn't seem to fit the puzzle is like coming across a word in another language in a textbook and memorizing it hastily. 

3. **Build upon the basics.** Still, the picture of what you're trying to learn doesn't have to be complete. Rather, make it simple - simple things are easy to understand and can easily be built upon. This mean the basics are crucial. Keep memorizing the basics. It has negligible cost because people usually spend 50% of their time repeating 3-5% of the learned material {% annotate <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/theory">"Theoretical aspects of spaced repetition in learning."</a> Piotr Wozniak. 1990-2000. %}. 

4. **Stick to the minimum information principle.** Make cards as simple as possible. Typically, beginners make cards that should be split into *ten or more* items! Simpler cards are better because simple, atomic information can be processed by the brain in the same way everytime you go over it which strengthens your ability to memorize it, as opposed to processing a complicated card a different way each time you encounter it, which interferes with the previous attempts at memorizing the card. Atomic cards also mean you repeat the cards you have trouble remembering more often rather than wasting time on the cards you already know. For these same reasons, it is better to make the answer *as short as possible*. 

5. **Cloze deletion is easy and effective.** Cloze can help beginners stick to the minimum information principle. 

6. **Use imagery.** The visual cortex is very well-developed by  evolution. It's certainly superior to our verbal memory. 

7. **Use mnemonic techniques.** Mnemonic techniques are useful, but you'll only need to apply them to 1-5% of your cards {% annotate I need to read more about mnemonic techniques. %}. 

8. **Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion.** Graphic deletion is when your card displays an image but you cover up a part of the image relating to the question. 

9. **Avoid sets.** Questions like "What countries belong to the European Union?" should be avoided because of the high cost of retaining memories based on sets. If memorizing a set is necessary, convert it to an enumerated list, through alphabetizing perhaps. Enumerations are still hard but slightly better because now the brain puts an order to the items and approaches the card in the same way every time. 

10. **Avoid enumerations.** 

11. **Combat interference.** Make items as unambigiuos as possible so no two cards have similar answers. 

12. **Optimize wording.** Optimize wording of cards so that the right part of your brain lights up in minimum time. This reduces errors, increases specificity, reduces response time, and helps concentration. 

13. **Refer to other memories.** 

### Farnam Street 

Treat the book as a conversation with the author. You can't talk directly to them but writing in the margins gets pretty close. This provides another heuristic to decide when to stop reading a book: if you're talking to the author, and the author is boring or isn't saying anything new, stop listening. 

At the end of each chapter, write bullet points to summarize. Make it personal if you can. After doing this for each chapter and finishing the book, leave the book and come back in a week. Then go through all the notes again. Write the ones you think are good on the inside cover along with the page number. 

### "On Books and Reading" by Arthur Schopenhauer 

Reading is just tracing in pen what the author has already written in pencil. There is no learning being done because there is no independent thinking occuring. Reading then can make you stupid: if you continuously let someone else think for you, you forget how to think yourself. 

Similarly,, reading a lot means that you're less likely to remember what you've read. Your brain is being overwritten continuously. 

Assume that the vast majority of books were written only to make money. Most of these are not worth your time. Never read a book because it is popular - ignore political, religious, or contemporary works. Bad books are intellectual poison; they destroy the mind. To read what is good, one must make it a condition never to read what is bad. 

Popular books are popular with the foolish majority. Refuse these and seek the books written by the rarest of minds, of all times and countries. Read only books written by people who live *for* science or poetry. 

Not even close to finishing reading this.
