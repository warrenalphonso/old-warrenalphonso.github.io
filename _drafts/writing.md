### Six Rules for Rewriting by Michael Nielsen 
[Link](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/six-rules-for-rewriting/)

To write well, first write freely then rewrite. To rewrite well, leave the good parts alone while fixing the bad parts. The following is how to recognize the bad parts. 

Every sentence should grab the reader and push them forward. Ensure each paragraph has a striking, original idea. This shouldn't be too hard; if it is, you probably need to think more deeply about what you're writing before writing. On that point, try to distill the significant ideas into a single strong sentence upon which the reader can focus. 

Stylistically, use the strongest verb you can while being accurate and actively avoid nominalization. Nominalization is when we weaken verbs by turning them into nouns and then combining them with weaker verbs.
