# Thought Experiments

## What would you change about high school? 

What would you do differently in high school? The way I think about this is by imagining my current self as a fifteen year old freshman and then plan my four years from then. But that's silly because to get an even better view I can just imagine my older self as a high school freshman. Though imagining my older self is almost impossible so I can do a best case scenario of sorts by projecting someone I really respect and admire onto a high school freshman and then thinking about what they would do in high school. Well not just do, but what would they value and what would their goals be? At first I thought about a great scientist like Feynman or Einstein as a high school freshman but I think these two rather quirky people wouldn't change much; they'd still mess around by asking themselves thoughtful questions about the universe but it seems they were both already doing that in high school. Maybe I think they wouldn't change anything because I don't really know much about them. Who do I know a lot about? Um. What about projecting Chilton onto a high school student? He would probably spend a lot of time reading and writing. He sure as heck wouldn't care about standardized testing as much and full on ignore popularity or trying to hang out with the cool kids. I don't even know if he'd try to woo a girl or make a group of best friends. Admission into an Ivy League probably wouldn't drive him; he knows he can be successful and have a good life without it. Actually he'd probably just use it as another lifetime to read more. Is that satisfying to him? I'm not sure what else he values...

## What would you change about college? 

Why not use the above experiment to decide how to structure my college experience? 

## Is love a good goal?
