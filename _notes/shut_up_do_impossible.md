What if doing better than your previous failures isn't enough? 

What if making a desperate effort, like your life was at stake, isn't enough?

What if the proble is impossible? Then shut up and do the impossible. 

If there isn't a proof of impossibility, it's just that no one thinks there's a way to do it, and it's *not* impossible. 

Step 1 is not saying "it's impossible" and running. "When there's a will to fail, obstacles can be found." 

Now suppose you want to **win**, not just try. *To win.* 

You could try, try again... but what if a *single failure isn't okay*? 

Now you start falling for traps... 

- stop yourself from just standing in front of the problem and *think* abou t how to beat it 
- *never forget* that setting out to make an effort is fully distinct from setting out to *win* 
- truly deciding to win creates an unbearable tension in your mind between the impossibility of the task and the requirement to do it. 
- Do not flee from this tension! 
- one way of fleeing is to seize a solution, any solution, even if it sucks. *Don't do this*. 
- don't assume the universe is fair enough to grant you success if you try desperately enough. This isn't a movie. 
- don't trick yourself into losing sight of why it's an impossible task. That only means you'll arrive at a bad solution. .

If you can state *exactly why* something is impossible, the solution is close. 

The tension is from not knowing which will prevail: impossibility of the task or your requirement to solve it. 

The certainty of uncertainty can itself be a relief so *reject it*! Or else it marks the end to desperation. 

Reject all the cheap ways to win. Stare at the wall in front of you. Collect yourself. Then walk forward through concrete.
