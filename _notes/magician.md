This is worth re-reading multiple times to think about the question: **Where could I advance non-linearly?**

I can also incorporate "Shut up and do the impossible" and "I wasn't prepared to work" so that I don't have to keep them in "Finished" list. They also approach the question of non-linear growth and decay from different angles.
