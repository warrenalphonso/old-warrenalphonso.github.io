Startup: a group of people you can persuade to help you build a specific future 

**Lessons.**

One of the "lessons" from the dot-com bubble is that startups should be lean, that is, unplanned, focused on iterating quickly, and eager to pivot to what works. This is misguided - WHY

**Competition.**

Monopolies are crucial to reaching the future. They can afford to think about long-term projects and innovations. Plus they have funds to invest in ambitious projects. 

Competition should be avoided. Its worst manifestation, perfect competition, drives all profits to 0. Even if it's just 2 companies competeting with each other, chasing ways to one-up the other incentivizes repeating/optimizing what has already been done. Firms locked in competition will lose to a newcomer (last-mover) who has more innovative and unconventional technology. 

Pick battles you *must* fight, and win quickly or stop fighting when it's clear you won't achieve the former. 

> "The primary thing... is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever that means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this... More than anything, you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him." - Miyamoto Musashi, *The Book of Five Rings*. 

Strong companies expect to make most of their revenue in the future: it usually takes time to build the future that you set out to build. This means durability is a more important metric than current growth, though I think growth is a good predictor of durability as long as you can capture most of your current growth for the long term. In other words, your growth must compound - high user turnover is the only situation I can think of where growth might be high but durability chances are low, but user turnover is pretty easy to notice. 

But Thiel's point is that a company must be *promising* enough for users to want to stay with it. That means it needs proprietary tech (at least a 10x improvement on anything else in the market), network effects, and economies of scale (software is awesome here since producing an additional unit costs nothing - just download the software). 

The best path for an early startup is to quietly dominate a small market - being loud or entering a large market attracts competition.
