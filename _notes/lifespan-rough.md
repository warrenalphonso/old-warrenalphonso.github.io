#### Chapter 1

27: There is no biological law that says we must age. 

32: *Magna superstes* was a very primitive organism that we think is the root of all life on Earth. It's survival mechanism is based on two genes. Gene A stops cells from reproducing when times are tough. Gene B encodes a "silencing protein" which turns off Gene A when times are good so *M. superstes* reproduces when offspring are likely to survive. Neither of these genes are novel except for the fact that Gene B's silencing protein has a repairing function and moves to broken DNA; this stops reproduction until the DNA repair is complete. 

37: *M. superstes*' survival circuit is why we are able to survive, but it also the reason we age. 

39: Aging research today is where cancer research was in the 1960s: only treating symptoms instead of stopping to think about how to stop the disease. We have a robust understanding of what aging looks like and what it does to us and what causes it and what keeps it at bay. From the looks of it, aging is not going to be that hard to treat, far easier than curing cancer. 

42: There has never been a unified theory of aging. 

45: The free radical theory of aging argues that free radicals cause mutations which cause aging. People took antioxidants to prevent free radicals. This theory has been bunked decades ago but people still believe it. 

45: Cloning gives us the answer to whether or not mutatins cause aging. If old cells losing information was the cause of aging, then we should never be able to clone a new animal from an old one. The cloned animal should be born old. Sure it's possible that only the non-mutated cells are cloned but that seems unlikely. The simplest explanation is that old animals retain all the information to create a new healthy animal. 

45: It's a misconception that cloned animals age prematurely: extensive analysis of Dolly's remains show no sign of premature aging even though she only lived half a normal lifespan. Meanwhile, the list of cloned animals who lived a normal healthy lifespan includes goats, sheep, mice, and cows. 

46: Researchers gave up on a unified model of aging and instead identified multiple hallmarks of aging: 
- genomic instability caused by DNA damaged 
- attrition of the telomeres 
- alterations to the epigenome that controls which genes are turned on and off 
- loss of healhty protein maintenance, known as proteostasis 
- deregulated nutrient sensing caused by metabolic changes 
- mitochondrial dysfunction 
- accumulation of senescent zombielike cells that inflame healthy cells 
- exhaustion of stem cells 
- altered intercellular communication and the production of inflammatory molecules 
This list is probably incomplete. 

50: Author's theory: aging is a loss of epigenetic information. 

50: There are two types of information in biology. DNA is like digital information: it can be reliably stored, accurately copied, and incredibly robust (can survive for hours in boiling water and recoverable from 40,000 year old Neanderthal remains). Epigenome is like analog information. Epigenome means traits that are heritable but not transmitted genetically. Epigenetic information is stored in a structure called chromatin, in the same way genetic information is stored in a structure called DNA. Epigenetic information orchestrates our cells. 

51: DNA is wrapped around tiny balls of protein called histones, which assemble to form loops. 

52: The epigenome tells newly divided cells what type of cells they should be and what they should remain. It's why a skin cells doesn't randomly become a brain cell. Without it, tissues become less and less functional until they fail. 

53: Analog information can encode much more information than digital but its main disadvantage is that it degrades over time. 

53: *M. superstes* has evolved into many different "longevity" genes in modern mammals. 

55: "Sirtuins" are an example of longevity genes, named after the yeast *SIR2* gene, the first to be discovered. There are 7 of these in mammals: *SIR1* to *SIR7* and are made by almost every cell in the body. They descended from Gene B from *M. superstes*. 

55: Sirtuins are enzymes that remove acetyl tags from histones and other proteins, and by doing so, change the packaging of the DNA, turning genes off and on when needed. These epigenetic regulators have evolved to control our health, fitness, and survival. They also evolved to requrie a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). 

55: We'll show later that the loss of NAD and decline of sirtuin activity is thought to be a primary reason for why our bodies develop diseases when we're old but not young. 

55: Sirtuins do what Gene B did by buckling down in times of stress and protecting us against diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, even cancer. Studies on mice indicate activating sirtuins causes DNA repair, boosts memory, incrases exercise endurance, and helps mice stay thing regardless of what they eat. 

56: Because sirtuins do all this by a simple program based on Gene B, they are amenable to more manipulation than many other longevity genes. 

56: Aside from sirtuins, a second easily manipulated longevity gene is called target of rapamycin (TOR). TOR is a complex of proteins that regulates growth and metabolism. TOR has been found in almost every animal (called mTOR in mammals). Like sirtuins, mTOR is regulated by nutrients. 

57: The third well-understood and easily manipulated longevity gene is a metabolic control enzyme called AMPK, which evolved to respond to low energy levels. 

57: Importantly, there are plenty of stressors that will activate longevity genes without damaging cells (certain types of exercise, intermittent fasting, low-protein diets, and exposure to hot and cold temperatures). This is called hormesis ["Hormesis: a fundamental concept in biology." Edward J. Calabrese.]
58: Comlementing these approaches are hormesis-mimicking molecules. At least two drugs on the market can turn on the body's defenses without creating *any* damage. We can mimic the benefits of exercise and intermittent fasting with a single pill. 

#### Chapter 2

59: In 2003, after a 13-year-$1-billion project, we believed the entire human genome, each of the 3 billion base pairs in DNA was mapped. The remaining parts of the genome were considered unimportant. Yet this remaining genetic material accounts for about 69% of the total genome. 

60: Even with a complete map, we won't be able to find an aging gene. We found genes that impact the symptoms of aging (longevity genes are an example). But we'll never find a gene that *causes* aging because our genes *didn't* evolve to cause aging. 

61: Robert Mortimer played a huge role in elevating *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, a single-celled yeast with a sweet tooth. Mortimer and his collaborator John Johnston discovered that these yeast cells are similar to our cells. There have been 5 Nobel Prizes awarded for genetic studies in yeast. *S. cerevisiae* shares about 70% of our genes. Mortimer and Johnston demonstrated that mother and daughter yeast cells can have vastly different lifespans. 

65: Werner symdrome occurs in less than 1 in 100,000 people causes a person to age rapidly - the average lifespan is 46 years. The gene WRN when mutated causes Werner syndrome. 

66: In yeast, the equivalent gene to WRN is Slow Growth Suppressor 1 (SGS1). SGS1 was suspected to code a type of enzyme called a DNA helicase. A DNA helicase untangles tangled strands of DNA before they break. Repetitive DNA sequences are prone to tangling and breaking. Since these repetitive sequences make up the majority of our genome, helicases are incredibly important. 

66: After swapping in a mutant SGS1 gene, the yeast cell's lifespan was cut in half. Many things can cause this but it seems Werner syndrome was induced because the cells seemed to age quickly: cells became larger and their descendant Gene A which causes sterility turned on earlier. 

69: The epigenome consists of strands of DNA wrapped around spooling proteins called histones, which are bound up into bigger loops called chromatin, which are bound up into bigger loops called chromosomes. Sirtuins instruct some histones to bind up quickly while letting others flail around. This allows some genes to be turned on (these genes are said to be in euchromatin) and others to be turned off (these genes are said to be in heterochromatin). Sirtuins help convert euchromatin to heterochromatin. 

69: Every one of our cells has the same DNA so what differentiates them is their epigenome, the collective term for the control systems and structures that tell the cell which genes should be turned on and off. The genome dictates what the epigenome can do (a caterpillar can't become a human) but the epigenome still has a lot of freedom. 

71: Studies of identical twins place the genetic influences on longevity between 10 and 25%, which is surprisingly low. 

74: The Werner yeast cells' rDNA was fragmenting. The loops were called extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (ERCs). This is a sign of age since normal yeast cells also were packed with ERCs when they grew old. 

75: Inserting ERCs into a young cell caused it to age prematurely. Inserting extra copies of *SIR2* increased lifespan by 30%. 

77: The evidence seemed clear: *SIR2* moves to the nucleolus, it does so to help repair ERCs; since *SIR2* moves from the reproductive parts, the cell becomes sterile, which is a hallmark of yeast cell growth. 

78: Mammals have seven sirtuin genes: *SIRT1*, *SIRT6*, and *SIRT7* are critical to control of the epigenome and DNA repair. The others, *SIRT3*, *SIRT4*, and *SIRT5*, reside in mitochondria where they control energy metabolism. *SIRT2* stays in the cytoplasm and controls cell division. 

78: In 2018, Katrin Chua at Stanford found sirtuins prevent senescence by stabilizing human rDNA. The same antiaging function found in yeast is confirmed to exist in humans. 

82: DNA damage is inevitable. If we think of sirtuins as disaster-responders, it's not so much that the sirtuins eventually get overwhelmed, but rather that they don't always find their way back to their original gene station when the disaster is over. This is epigenetic noise: epigenetic factors like sirtuins leave the genome and get lost; wherever they end up on the genome alters genes by turning them on or off when they shouldn't be. 

82: How does the *SIR2* gene turn off genes? *SIR2* codes a specialized protein called a histone deacetylase (HDAC) that enzymatically cleaves the acetyl chemical tags from histones which prevents DNA from being transcribed into RNA. Whenever a DNA break occurs, *SIR2* moves there and removes the acetyl tags from the histones at the DNA break. This bundles up the histones to prevent the frayed DNA from being chewed back. 

88: Horvath Clock is an accurate way of estimating someone's biological age by measuring thousands of epigenetic marks on the DNA called methylation. **I should try to find my Horvath age.**

84: Mice were injected with a slime mold called *Physarum polycephalum* which floats around and cuts DNA in a mouse at just a few places when triggered by tamoxifen. All this does is break the DNA in a few places and cause sirtuins to be busy and maybe get lost. The mice with this aged 50% faster. 

90: Bristlecone pine trees don't age. Researchers couldn't find any meaningful difference between 23 and 4713 year old bristlecones. 

101: When treated with an NAD-boosting molecule that activated the *SIRT1* enzyme, the mice's endothelial cells (which line the blood vessels) were pushing their way into areas of the muscle that weren't getting much blood flow. Old mice suddenly became marathoners. Because sirtuins were activated, the mice's epigenomes were becoming more stable. 

#### Chapter 3

116: If we could stop all cardiovascular disease, we would increase the average lifespan by 1.5 years. If we could cure all cancers, we would increase average lifespan by only 2.1 years. Curing one disease just means risk of getting another increases exponentially. Aging is the root cause of all of this. 

120: Cigarette smoke contains a chemical called benzo(a)pyrene which binds to guanine in DNA, induces double-strand breaks, and causes mutations. The repair process causes epigenetic drift and metabolic changes that cancer cells thrive on in a process called geroncogenesis. 

123: A gene called LINE-1 replicate and causes cellular havoc as we grow older. 

#### Chapter 4 

129: Places with centenarian-heavy populations eat more vegetables, legumes, and whole grains while cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugar. 

133: Caloric restriction (CR) in rats and yeast lead to longer lifespans. 

136: What we know about the impacts of lifelong calorie restriction in humans comes down to short-term studies and anecdotal experiences. But in the 1980s, we began a CR study on rhesus monkeys, our close genetic cousins. Before the study, the maximum known lifespan of rhesus monkeys was 40 years, but of the 20 monkeys in the study on CR diets, 6 reached taht age, which is roughly equivalent to a human reaching 120. 

137: Rozalyn Anderson, a lead researcher in the rhesus monkey study, says a 30 percent CR diet for humans is a bonkers diet. 

139: Participants in one study ate a normal diet for most of the time but turned to a restricted diet of vegetable soups, energy bars, and supplements for five days each month. After 3 months, they had lost weight, reduced body fat, and lowered blood pressure. The participants also had lower levels of IGF-1. 

139: Mutations in IGF-1 and the IGF-1 receptor gene are associated with lower levels of death and disease. The impact is so strong that in some cases it's used to predict how long someone will live. **Measure my IGF-1 levels.** 

141: Any periodic fasting diet that doesn't result in malnutrition is likely to put your longevity genes to work. 

142: We need nine essential amino acids that are body can't make on its own. Meat supplies all nine but comes with  high cardiovascular motaility and cancer risk. Processed red meats (hot dogs, sausage, ham, bacon) are especially carcinogenic. Substituting animal protein with plant protein causes mortaility risk to fall significantly. 

143: There isn't a single amino acid that can't be obtained from plant-based protein but any given plant usually delivers less than meat. This is actually good because a body in short supply of amino acids is under the sort of stress that engages our longevity genes. 

143: All essential amino acids aren't equal. Feeding mice low levels of methionine works well to increase a healthy lifespan by 20%. Even mice who ate as much as they wanted and shunned exercise lost 70% of fat in a month when on restricted methioine. Arginine and the 3 branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine also correlate with increased lifespan when restricted. 

146: People who jogged at least a half hour for five days a week had telomeres that appeared to be nearly a decade younger than those who lived a more sedentary life. 

146: Why does exercise delay the erosion of telomeres? Exercise is by definition a stressful activity: it raises NAD levels which activates the survival network. The longevity regulators AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins are all activated to build blood vessels, improve heart and lung health, make people stronger, and extend telomeres. *SIRT1* and *SIRT2* extend telomeres and protect them from degradation. 

147: Running 4-5 miles a week reduces chance of heart attack by 40% and all-cause mortality by 45%. Intensity is important for engaging longevity genes so walk is distinct from a brisk run. HIIT is the best because it raises heart and expiration rates the most. Your breathing should be deep and rapid at 70-80% of your maximum heart rate.

148: Diet is still important; you can't eat what you want and run it off. Giving rats a high calorie diet with lots of exercise has minimal lifespan extension. 

150: In 2006, researchers at Scripps engineered mice to live their lives a half degree cooler than normal. Female mice had a 20% increase in lifespan while male mice had a 12% increase. They did this by inserting copies of the mouse gene UCP2 into the hypothalamus: UCP2 short-circuited mitochondria in the hypothalamus to produce less energy but more heat which caused the mice to cool down half a degree Celsius. 

153: The UCP2 gene in mice has a human analog too. It has also been linked with aging repeatedly. In 2017, it was discovered that colder temperatures changed the way the UCP2 gene operated. Brown adipose tissue is a mitochondria-rich substance that decreases in amount as we age. It mingles with white fat and is spread out unevenly throughout the body. It generally takes a PET scan to locate it. Animals with abundant brown fat or subjected to shivering cold for 3 hours a day have much more of the mitochondrial, UCP-boosting sirtuin, *SIRT3*, and experience reduced rates of diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's. 

154: Chemicals called mitochondrial uncouplers can mimic the effect of UCP2 by allowing protons to leak through mitochondrial membranes, causing not cold but heat as a by-product. 

154: 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) was used for making explosives in WWI. It was later discovered that DNP markedly increased metabolic rate; people were losing 3 pounds a week. Soon, people started dying from overdoses and other long-term side effects. It is extremely dangerous. 

156: Exercising in the cold creates massive amounts of brown adipose tissue. (read source on this 52 in Ch4) 

157: We get the same effect in very hot climates too. *S. cerevisiae*'s lifespan extends 30% when they're grown in 37 degrees C, just short of the maximum temperature they can sustain. The heat boosts their NAD production so their *SIR2* proteins work much harder. It's also the same mechanism evoked by calorie restriction. 

157: This isn't the same for humans because we're warm-blooded, so our enzymes haven't developed a tolerance for large changes in temperature. 

158: Going to saunas once a week seems to be good for you but studies aren't conclusive. 

158: A little cellular stress is good because it activates AMPK, turns down mTOR, boosts NAD levels, and activates sirtuins. 

159: We *don't want to* prevent *all* DNA damage: it's essential for the immune system and even for consolidating our memories. (Read the source 57 Ch4) 

#### Chapter 5 

157: The single-celled organism *Streptomyces hygroscopicus* secretes an antifungal compound called rapamycin which was discovered to be an effective supressor of the immune system. It was effective in subduing the immune system just enough so that an organ transplant could be successful. Rapamycin is also useful for longevity: fruit flies fed rapamycin live 5% longer and mice fed it live 9-14% longer. 

160: Rapamycin inhibits TOR. Many researchers are looking for "rapalogs" which are TOR inhibitors like rapamycin but with greater specificity and less toxicity. 

160: *Galega officinalis* is a purple flower whose chemical composition is rich in guanidine, an indicator in humans of healthy protein metabolism. 

160: In the 1920s, doctors began to prescribe guanidine as a way to lower blood glucose levels in diabetics. 

161: Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough hormones that alert the body to sugar. This is widely treated by supplemental insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas can make enough insulin but the body is deaf to it. People with type 2 need a drug that restores their body's sensitivity to insulin so cells can use the sugar coursing through their bloodstream. 

161: High blood sugar can also speed up the epigenetic clock. 

161: Oral dimethyl biguanide, a derivative of the *Galega officinalis*, is an effective treatment for type 2 diabets. This drug is now called metformin. It costs less than $5 a month. Except for a rare condition called lactic acidosis, the most common side effect is stomach discomfort. 

162: People taking metformin were living notably healthier lives independent of its effect on diabetes. In 26 studies of rodents treated with metformin, 25 showed protection from cancer. 

162: Metformin mimics aspects of calorie restriction but instead of inhibiting TOR, it limits the metabolic reactions in mitochondria, slowing down the process by which they convert macronutrients into energy. The result is activation of AMPK, an enzyme known for its ability to respond to low energy levels and the restore the function of the mitochondria. It also activates *SIRT1*. Metformin also inhibits cancer cell metabolism, increases mitochondrial activity, and removes misfolded proteins. 

163: A study of more than 41,000 metformin users between ages 68 and 81 concluded that metformin reduced the likelihood of dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, frailty, and depression. 

163: The beauty of metformin is that it impacts many diseases: AMPK activation and NAD production and turning on sirtuins hepls a lot. 

164: A small study of healthy volunteers claimed DNA methylation age of blood cells is reversed within a week and, astoundingly, only ten hours after taking a single 850 mg pill of metformin. 

164: Barzilai discovered several longevity gene variants in the insulin-like growth hormone receptor that controls FOXO3, the cholesterol gene CETP, and the sirtuin *SIRT6*, all of which seem to help ensure some people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry remain healthy beyond 100. 

166: The first *SIRT1*-activating compound, or STAC, was a polyphenol called fisetin, which helps give plants such as strawberries their color and is now known to also kill senescent cells. 

167: The second was a molecule called butein, which can be found in numerous flowering plants as well as a toxic plant known as the Chinese lacquer tree. 

169: Zipkin noticed that fisetin and butein both have two phenolic rings connected by a bridge. He also pointed out the antioxidant resveratrol had the same structure. 

169: Resveratrol is a natural molecule found in red wine and is something many plants produce in times of stress. Resveratrol actually outperformed fisetin and butein. 

170: Resveratrol-fed yeast were smaller and grew slightly more slowly, getting to an average 34 divisions before dying, as though they were calorie restricted. The human equivalent is an extra 50 years. 

170: Resveratrol in yeast cells with no *SIR2* gene had no effect. Resveratrol on calorie restricted yeast also had no effect. 

170: Resveratrol being produced by plants experiencing stress is part of a common trend. We get resveratrol from grapes, aspirin from willow bark, metformin from lilacs, epigallocatechin gallate from green tea, quercetin from fruits, and allicin from garlic. This seems to be evidence for xenohormesis: the idea that stressed plants produce chemicals for themselves that tell their cells to hunker down and survive. We might have evolved to sense these chemicals as an early-warning system. 

171: Xenohormetic molecules are often yellow, red, orange, or blue, so highly colored fruit are more likely to have them. They also tend to taste better: the best wines in the world are produced in dry, sun-exposed soil or from stress-sensitive varietals and also contain the most resveratrol. 

171: Resveratrol-fed fruit flies and groundworms lived longer. Giving resveratrol to human cells in culture dishes makes them resistant to DNA damage. 

172: Feeding resveratrol to fat mice: the mice stayed fat, but when disected, the resveratrol mice looked identical to mice on a normal diet, with healthy hearts, livers, arteries, and muscles. They also lived 20% longer. Researhers went on to show in hundreds of studies that resveratrol protects mice against dozens of diseases, including a variety of cancers, heart disease, stroke, heart attacks, neurodegeneration, inflammatory diseases, and wound healing. When resveratrol is combined with intermittent fasting, it greatly extends average and maximum lifespan: out of 50 mice, 1 lived more than 3 years which is the human equivalent of 115 years. 

173: It turns out resveratrol isn't very potent and isn't very soluble in the human gut, two attribues that most medicines need to be effective at treating diseases. 

173: Resveratrol taught us that it's possible to activate sirtuins with a chemical. This prompted research into other sirtuin-activating compounds, called STACs, that are more potent than resveratrol at stimulating the survival circuit and extending healthy lifespans. Examples include SRT1720 and SRT2104, both of which extend healthy lifespan of mice when given late in life. 

173: Another STAC is NAD, sometimes written as NAD+. NAD has an advantage over other STACs because it boosts activity of all seven sirtuins. 

174: It turned out that NAD is a product of the vitamin niacin, a severe lack of which causes inflamed skin, diarrhea, dementia, and ultimately death. Because NAD is used by over 500 different enzymes, without any NAD, we'd be dead in 30 seconds. 

174: In the 1990s, we learned that NAD wasn't just keeping things running; it was a central regulator of many major biological processes, including aging and disease. 

174: NAD acts as fuel for sirtuins. Without sufficient NAD, the sirtuins don't work efficiently: they can't remove the acetyl groups from histones, they can't silence genes, and they can't extend lifespan. And we definitely wouldn't see the lifespan-extending impact of resveratorl. NAD levels decrease with age throughout the body, in the brain, blood, muscle, immune cells, pancreas, skin, and even the endothelial cells. 

175: In yeast, Sinclair discovered a gene called *PNC1* which turns vitamin B_3 into NAD. They tried boosting *PNC1* by introducing four extra copies of it into the yeast cells so they had 5 copies total. Those cells lived 50% longer, but not if they removed the *SIR2* gene. The cells were making extra NAD and the sirtuin survival circuit was being engaged! 

175: The human equivalent of *PNC1* is *NAMPT*. Since *NAD* is so important, it might be dangerous to experiment with it. 

175: Brenner discovered that a form of vitamin B_3 called nicotinamide riboside, or NR, is a vital precursor of NAD. He found that NR, which is found in trace levels in milk, can extend the lifespan of yeast cells by boosting NAD and increasing the activity of *SIR2*. Once a rare chemical, NR is now sold by the ton as a nutraceutical. 

175: A chemical called nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN, a compound made by our cells and found in foods such as avocado, broccoli, and cabbage. In the body, NR is converted into NMN, which is then converted into NAD. Give an animal with a drink with NR or NMN in it, and the levels of NAD in its body go up about 25% over the next couple of hours, about the same as if it had been fasting or exercising a great deal. NMN could treat symptoms of type 2 diabetes in old mice by restoring NAD levels. We can make the mitochondria in old mice function just like mitochondria in young mice after just a week of NMN injections. 

176: Which is the superior molecule: NR or NMN? We find NMN to be more stable than NR and see some benefits in mice that aren't seen when NR is used. But it's NR that has been proven to extend the lifespan of mice. NMN is still being tested. So no definitive answer (watch podcast to see if updates on this). 

177: Human studies with NAD boosters are ongoing. So far, there hasn't been any toxicity. Studies to test its effectiveness in muscle and neurological disease are in progress. 

177: The way NAD treats diseases and extends lifespan is by creating the right level of stress: just enough to push our longevity genes into action to suppress epigenetic changes. In doing so, NMN and other vitality molecules including metformin and rapamycin reduce the buildup of informational noise. 

177: We still don't fully understand how noise is dampened on the molecular level, but in principle we know how it works. When we give silencing proteins like sirtuins a boost, they can maintain the youthful epigenome even with DNA damage occuring, like the long-lived yeast cells with extra copies o the *SIR2* gene. Somehow they can cope with it. Maybe they are just efficient at repairing DNA breaks and head hope before they get lost or if half the sirtuins head off, the remaining enzymes can hold down the fort. 

177: Sinclair's students and family members take supplemental NMN. 

182: Sitting is almost as bad for us as smoking. 

182: Sinclair's father started taking metformin for diabetes and NMN. Six months into his NMN tryout, he was feeling less tired, less sore, more mentally aware. His liver enzymes normalized after 20 years of being abnormal. 

188: Once you recognize there are universal regulators of aging in everything from yeast to roundworks to mice to humans. Once you understand that these regulators can be changed with a molecule like NMN or a few hours of vigorous exercise or a few less meals. Once you realize it's all just one disease. Aging is going to be remarkably easy to tackle. Easier than cancer. 

190: Young human cells grown in a petri dish divide about 40-60 ties until their telomeres become critically short. This is called the Hayflick limit. Although the enzyme telomerase can extend telomeres, it is switched off to protect us from cancer, except in stem cells. 

190: In 1997, it was discovered that if you put telomerase into cultured skin cells, they don't ever senesce. 

190: Why do short telomeres cause senescence: a very short telomere will lose its histone packaging and, like a shoelace that's lost an aglet, the DNA at the end of the chromosome becoems exposed. The cell detects the DNA end and thinks it's a DNA break. It goes to work to try to repair the DNA end, sometimes fusing two ends of different chromosomes together, which leads to hypergenome instability as chromosomes are shredded during cell division and fused again, over and over, potentially becoming a cancer. The other safer solution is to shut the cell down. This happens, Sinclair believes, by permanently engaging the survival circuit. The exposed telomere, seen as a DNA break, causes epigenetic factors such as sirtuins to leave their posts permanently in an attempt to repair the damage, but there is no other DNA end to ligate it to. This shuts down cell replication similar to the way broken DNA in old yeast distracts *SIR2* from the mating genes and shuts down fertility. Permanently panicked cells send out signals to surrounding cells, causing them to panic, too. 

191: Senescent cells are often referred to as "zombie cells," because even though they should be dead, they refuse to die. We can stain zombie cells blue because they make a rare enzyme called beta-galactosidase, and when we do that, they light up clearly. Even though they stop dividing, they continue to release tiny proteins called cytokines that cause inflammation and attract immune cells called macrophages that then attack the tissue. Being chronically inflamed is unhealthy: just ask someone with multiple sclerosis or psoriasis. These diseases are associated with excess cytokine proteins. 

192: Cytokines don't just cause inflammation; they also cause other cells to become zombies. When this happens, they can even stimulate surrounding cells to become a tumor and spread. 

192: We already know that destroying senescent cells in mice can give them substantially healthier and significantly longer lives. It keeps their kidneys functioning better for longer. It makes their hearts more resistant to stress. Their lifespans, as a result, are 20-30% longer, according to Mayo Clinic. 

192: In animal models of disease, killing senescent cells makes fibrotic lungs more pliable, slows the progression of glaucoma and osteoarthrisis, and reduces the size of all sorts of tumors. 

194: Intro: The primordial survival circuit we've inherited causes our cells to eventually lose their identities and cease to divide, in some cases sitting in our tissues for decades. Senescent cells are hard to reverse aging in, so the best thing to do is kill them off. Drugs called senolytics are in development to do that. 

194: Senescence is a consequence of our inherited primordial survival circuit, which evolved to stop cell division and reproduction when DNA breaks were detected. If DNA breaks happen too frequently or overwhelm the circuit, human cells stop dividing, then sit there in a panic, trying to repair the dmaage, messing up their epigenome, and secreting cytokines. 

194: Why doesn't our body just kill them off? Williams proposes that we evolved senescence as a clever trick to prevent cancer when we are in our 30s and 40s. Senescent cells don't divide which means that cells with mutations aren't able to spread and form tumors. This is where "antagonistic pleiotropy" comes into play: the idea that a survival mechanism that is good for us when we are young is kept through evolution because this far outweighs any problems it might cause when we are older. 

196: A class of pharmaceuticals called senolytics may be the zombie killers we need to fight aging on this front. These small-molecule drugs are designed to kill senescent cells by inducing the death program that should have happened in the first place. Kirkland did this with a quick course of two senolytic molecules: quercetin, which is found in kale and red onions, and a drug called dasatinib, which is a standard chemotherapy treatment for leukemia. This treatment on lab mice extended their lifespan by 36%. 

196: If senolytics work, you could take a course of medicine for a week, be rejuvenated, and come back ten years later for another course. Rapamycin is called a "senomorphic" molecule since it doesn't kill senescent cells but does prevent them from releasing inflammatory molecules, which is almost as good. 

196: The selfish genes discussed earlier, the LINE-1 retrotransposons, and their fossil remnants, make up about half the human genome and is often referred to as "junk DNA". 

197: In young cells, these ancient "mobile DNA elements," also known as retrotransposons, are prevented by chromatin from jumping out of the genome, then breaking DNA to reinsert themselves elsewhere. LINE-1 genes are bundled up and rendered silent by sirtuins. As mice age, and possibly as we do as well, these sirtuins become scattered all over the genome, having been recruited away to repair DNA breaks elsewhere, and many of them never find their way home. 

197: Without sirtuins to spool the chromatin and silence the transposon DNA, cells start to transcribe these endogenous viruses. As mice age, the once silent LINE-1 prisoners are turned into RNA and the RNA is turned into DNA, which is reinserted into the genome at a different place. Besides creating genome instability and epigenetic noise that causes inflammation, LINE-1 DNA leaks from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it is recognized as a foreign invader. The cells release even more immunostimulatory cytokines that caues inflammation throughout the body. 

197: Sedivy raises the possibility that *SIRT6* (?) mutant mice age so rapidly because these retroviral hellhounds have no leash, causing numerous DNA breaks and the epigenome to degrade rapidly instead of slowly. Convincing evidence has come showing that antiretrovirals, the same kinds used to fight HIV, extend the lifespan of *SIRT6* mutant mice about twofold. It may turn out that, as NAD levels decline which age, sirtuins are rendered unable to silence retrotransposon DNA. Maybe one day, safe antiretroviral drugs or NAD boosters will be used to keep these jumping genes silent. 

198: By injecting mice with stem cells inactivated by radiation and later adding a booster shot like those humans use for tetanus, hepatitis B, and whooping cough, the stem cells primed the immune system to attack cancers that normally would be invisible to the immune system. Therapies which modify the patient's own immune T-cells and reinject them to go kill cancer cells, are saving lives. If we can use the immune system to kill cancer cells, we should be able to do that to senescent cells too. 

201: Vaccines against senescent cells, CR mimetics, and retrotransposon suppressors are under way already in labs. But what if we didn't need any of that? What if we could reset the aging clock and prevent cells from ever losing their identity and becoming senescent in the first place? (does this question mean senescent cells are the root cause of everything?) The solution could be cellular reprogramming, the way that jellywish for example have been shown to do by using small body fragments to regenerate polyps that spawn a dozen new jellies. Since cloning works, we know the DNA blueprint to be young is always there. 

202: There are 2 ways to play a scratched DVD with fidelity: buy a better DVD player (one with a more powerful laser that could reveal the data under the scratches) or polish the disk to expose the information again. 

202: The first appraoch (putting a scratched DVD into a new player) was first attempted in 1958 when we removed the chromosomes from a frog's egg and replaced them with chromosomes from an adult frog and obtained living tadpoles. We also did this with Dolly. 

205: Shannon noted that if the data exceeded the channel capacity or was subject to noise (which occurs with analog data), the best way to ensure it reaches the receiver is to store a backup. Even if the primary data is lost, an "observer" can send this "correcting data" to a "correcting device" to recover the original message. This is how the internet works thanks to TCP/IP. The observer notes the errors in the recovered message and transmits the correct data to the receiver over a correction channel. 

206: Since cloning works, we know the information to tell a cell how to reset is there somewhere; it is backed up. To end aging, we need to find an observer, correction data, and correcting device. 

207: Shinya Yamanaka announced a set of 4 genes (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc) that when given to an adult cell could induce it to become pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which are immature cells that can be coaxed into becoming any other cell type. Sinclair thinks this is the biological correcting device. These 4 genes code for powerful transcription factors that each controls entire sets of other genes that decide what a cell will become in embryonic development. We call these 4 genes Yamanaka factors. 

207: Sinclair predicts we can use the Yamanaka factors to reset an entire body's epigenetic landscape, sending sirtuins back to where they came from for example. 

208: In the future, we might give someone an injection of a specially engineered adeno-associated virus which would carry some combination of the Yamanaka factors and a fail-safe switch that could turned on with a well-tolerated molecule such as doxycycline. Then in your mid-40s, you would be prescribed a month's course of doxycycline to switch on the reprogramming genes. During that month, your body would undergo a rejuvenation process: gray hair would disappear, wounds would heal faster, wrinkles would fade, organs would regenerate, you'd think faster, hear higher-pitched sounds, and no longer need glasses. Then you'd stop the doxycycline and the Yamanaka factors would fall silent. 

209: In 2016, Belmonte triggered the Yamanaka factors for just 2 days a week throughout the lifespan of a prematurely aging mouse breed called LMNA. The mice remained young compared to their untreated siblings and lived 40% longer. Their skin and kidneys of regular old mice healed more quickly too. The Yamanaka treatment was toxic, however. Giving the treatment for a few more days made the mice die. They got particularly disgusting tumors made up of several types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, or bone. 

210: Yuancheng Lu left out the c_Myc gene in the Yamanaka factors. None of the mice got tumors. Instead of testing it for a year to see if the mice lived longer, Yuancheng used a mouse's optic nerve as a way to test age reversal and rejuvenation. Optic nerves typically don't regenerate unless you're a newborn. The nerve regenerated. 

213: If we can reprogram old nerves to regain a youthful epigenome, the information must definitely be stored somewhere, a repository of correction data must be retained through adulthood. And it must be accessible by the Yamanaka factors. What the exact youth markers are, we still don't know. They likely involve methyl tags on DNA which are used to estimate an organism's Horvath clock. They likely also involve something else: a protein, an RNA, or even a novel chemical attached to DNA that we haven't yet discovered. 

215: Intro: By infecting mice with 3 of the four Yamanaka factors, the age of cells is reversed by TET enzymes, which removes just the right methyl tags on DNA, reversing the clock of aging. How the enzymes know which tags are the youthful ones is a mystery. Solving that mystery is the equivalent to finding Shannon's "observer," the person who holds the original data. 

215: The "observer" can't just be DNA methylation, because that doesn't explain how the reprogrammed cell knows to focus on some of the youthful methyl marks and strip off the ones that accumulated during aging, the equivalent of scratches on the DVD. Maybe it is a specialized histone, or a transcription factor, or a protein that latches onto methylated DNA when we are developing in utero and stays there for 80 years waiting until a signal ocomes from the correcting device to restore the original information. 

215: To continue the analogy to Shannon: when the "correcting device" is switched on by infecting cells with OSK genes, the cell somehow knows how to contact the "observer" and use the "correction data" to restore the original signal of a young cell. 

216: We know from experiments (which?) that the biological information "correcting device" requires enzymes called ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs) which clip off methyl tags from DNA, the same chemical tags that mark the passage of the Horvath clock. This isn't a coincidence: it points to the DNA methylation clock as not just an indicator of age but a controller of it. 

216: The TETs cannot just strip off all the methyls from the genome: that would turn a cell into a primordial stem cell. How the TETs know to remove only the more recent methyls while preserving the original ones is a mystery. 

217: So far, the 3 Yamanaka factor combination seems safe in mice even after being turned on for a year. 

217: Questions we have: Can we deliver this combination to all cells? Will it eventually cause cancer? Should we keep the genes on or turn them off to let the cells rest? Will this work in some tissues better than others? Can it be given to middle-aged people, before they become sick? 

226: We can read an entire human genome of 25,000 genes in a few days for less than a hundred dollars on a DNA sequencer called a MinION that plugs into a laptop. And that's for a fairly complete readout of the human genome plus the DNA methyl marks that tell you your biological age. 

226: DNA can also tel you what foods to eat, what microbiomes to cultivate in your gut and skin, and what therapies will work best to reach maximum potential lifespan. 

231: More than a hundred companies help with this. Check citation 18 in Ch7. 

234: In 2017, the FDA approved a glucose sensor you can attach to skin to provide a constant readout of blood sugar levels on your phone or watch. Patrick, a longevity scientist, uses it to see what foods give her a major sugar spike. This is good because sugar spikes can vary from person to person. 

235: Sinclair has a ring that monitors heart rate, body temperature, and movements. It tells him each morning how well he slept, how much he dreamed, and how alert he'll be during the day. Check citation 23. 

358: What Sinclair does: 
    - take 1 gram of NMN every morning with 1 gram of resveratrol (shaken into homemade yogurt) and 1 gram of metformin 
    - daily dose of vitamin D, vitamin K_2, and 83 mg of aspirin 
    - keep sugars, bread, pasta intake low 
    - skip one meal a day or at least make it really small
    - every few months, a phlebotomist comes to draw blood which is analyzed for dozens of biomarkers. When markers aren't optimal, he moderates them with food or exercise. 
    - takes lots of steps a day and walks upstairs. 
    - goes to gym on weekends: lift weights, jog, sauna, ice-cold pool 
    - eat lots of plants and few animals 
    - stay cool when sleeping 
    - BMI in optimal range which is 23-25 for him 

359: Supplements are far, far less regulated than medicines so be careful. Look for "GMP" on label (Good manufacturing practices). Nicotinamide riboside, or NR, is converted to NMN, so some people take NR instead of NMN since it's cheaper. Even cheaper are niacin and nicotinamide, but they don't seem to raise NAD levels like NR and NMN. 












# Rewritten notes

**What's the Epigenome?**

The genome is the complete collection of all DNA base pairs. It holds the instructions to manufacture all the proteins we might need. Almost every cell in your body contains a copy of the full genome. The [epigenome](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Epigenomics-Fact-Sheet) is the collection of compounds that can turn parts of the genome on and off. This is what allows cells to differentiate. Some of these changes can be inherited during cell division. 

There are [2 (I think?) methods the epigenome uses to mark the genome](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Epigenomics-Fact-Sheet): 

1. DNA methylation: Proteins attach methyl groups to DNA. ***What do methyl groups do?***
2. Histone modification: Histones are proteins that bind DNA into loops [p51]. Proteins can modify histones by attaching chemical tags to them. These tags will tell the cell whether or not to use the DNA that's packaged by the histone. 

The genome is to hardware what the epigenome is to software. 

Sinclair compares the genome to digital information: it's made up of 4 base pairs and incredibly robust (DNA can survive in boiling water for hours and is recoverable from 40,000 year old Neanderthal remains) and compares the epigenome to analog information: it's complex and hard to copy. 

**Epigenetic Noise Theory of Aging.**

Sinclair believes *aging is due to a loss of epigenetic information.*

A popular theory of aging is that it's due to genetic mutations. The success of cloning efforts indicate this is false. If old cells lost important information, we shouldn't be able to create young cells by cloning them. A cloned animal should be born old. This was first attempted in 1958 when we replaced chromosomes in a frog egg with chromosomes from an adult frog and obtained tadpoles. So far, [cloned goats, dog, sheep, mice, cats, and pigs have been able to reach their normal lifespan](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/452444). This means the genetic mutations we acquire as we age probably isn't the cause of aging; somehow, all the information needed to create a young animal is present in the cells of an old one. 

**Longevity Genes.** 

Sinclair believes all life on Earth is a descendant of a primitive organism called *M. superstes*. Its survival mechanism consisted of 2 main genes. Gene A stopped cells from reproducing, while Gene B silenced other genes and had the capability to repair broken DNA. When there wasn't any DNA to repair, Gene B silenced Gene A so the cells would reproduce, but when the cells were under stress, Gene B went off to fix broken DNA which meant Gene A was able to turn on and stop reproduction [p32]. 

There are many "longevity genes" in organisms today which provide the same functionality: reproduce when times are good and hunker down when times are bad. 

Sirtuins (a class of proteins) are an example of longevity genes. There are 7 in mammals: *SIRT1, SIRT6, SIRT7* control the epigenome and DNA repair, *SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5* control metabolism in the mitochondria, and *SIRT2* resides in the cytoplasm and controls cell division (p78). Yeast has 5 sirtuins. Sirtuins work by removing acetyl tags from histones and other proteins, turning genes on and off (p55). 

Sirtuins seem to do what Gene B did in *M. superstes*: activating sirtuins in mice causes DNA repair, boosts memory, increases endurance, and helps mice stay thin (p53). 

Another longevity gene is target of rapamycin, called TOR. 

**Early Evidence.** 

**Calorie Restriction and Intermittent Fasting.** 

**Exercise.**

**Temperature.**

**NAD.**

Sirtuins evolved to require the molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, called NAD (p53).  

**Rapamycin.**

**Metformin.**

**Senescence.**

**Reversing Aging.**

**The Regimen.**



**Ethics.** 

A fair chunk of the book was spent persuading the reader that aging is worth attacking. I won't cover much of that here, except for the following argument for the importance of fighting aging. In the US, [23.4% of deaths in 2017 were caused by heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm) and [22% of deaths in 2016 were caused by cancer](https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/facts-and-figures-2019.html). However, because as we age, the risk of contracting diseases increases exponentially, stopping all heart disease would increase the average lifespan by only 1.5 years while curing cancer would increase it by 2.1 years [p111] ***SOURCE?***. Preventing our bodies from weakening is a prerequisite to any meaningful benefit from curing many diseases.
