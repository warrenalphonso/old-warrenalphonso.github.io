**An External Brain.** 

The Zettelkasten is a note-taking system that attempts to build a better brain. Notes are distilled into their individual ideas, and each idea is paraphrased on one side of an index card. Index cards are placed in a container so that related cards are located next to each other.

Our brains are unpredictable and mysterious. Suppose we wanted to build a better brain. Here's an attempt at creating a communicating partner with the Zettelkasten that has brain-like features:

*Linking of ideas*: We want to strengthen ideas by relating them to other ideas. The Zettelkasten accomplishes this by giving each zettel (index card) its own *unique, permanent* ID. This allows any zettel to reference another related zettel just by writing down the ID. 

*Arbitrary branching*: Ideas are most valuable when surrounded by the proper context, which isn't always the source you first encountered in. The Zettelkasten achieves this by making the ID of each card alphanumeric: to place a new card behind a related existing card with the ID 22, give the new card an ID of 23. If 23 already exists, use 22a. This allows for arbitrarily deep dives into any topic without premeditation on how to organize the information in a useful way. 

*Non-linear and unordered*: Any sort of system with an order is doomed because it necessarily loses its functionaly once it becomes very dense. There's no way to predict which topics or how intensly we'll study years down the road so any organizational structure which imposes a hierarchy of folders and dividers eventually gets to a point where choosing where to put information is harder than actually learning the information. 

*Complexity only on the content level*: Our brains store an unfathomable expanse of knowledge without getting wrapped up in organizational details. The Zettelkasten's simple structure accomplishes this: if we think something is important, we can defer to putting it in the Zettelkasten. If it's important, other zettels will link to and from it. It it isn't important, it'll get lost in isolation. Both scenarios are fine (as long as the latter occurs in minority) which prevents paralysis of indecision of whether/where to add information. 

*Higher-level thinking*: The Zettelkasten has economies of scale unlike other note-taking systems which become exponentially more cumbersome with the number of notes. At first, the Zettelkasten will just be a repository of information, but after several months, once it develops a critical mass of information, the Zettelkasten develops arguments and ideas on its own through the interconnectivity and new contexts of ideas inputted. This requires a lot of effort, especially at first, to avoid the system from just becoming an archive of notes.

It would help if our external brain could also help us get work done: 

*Easy to work in*: We shouldn't have to force ourselves to be productive or work harder. Self-control is a finite resource that is depleting when used on tasks we're conflicted on doing [1]. Tasks are easiest to get done when they're well-defined, meaningful, and interesting. A way to monitor resistance and avoid it: count the number of zettels you write in a day. This is a reliable metric of productivity since each zettel represents a distilled idea. 

*Trust*: System needs to be trusted to hold what it's important in an easily accessible way. The Zettelkasten ensures important ideas have many branches and a high volume of cards. To get rid of junk, write it down somewhere. It's even benefician to not commit everything in the Zettelkasten to memory: if you memorize a zettel, when you come across it you'll not truly read the zettel but just think of what you remember it saying. Instead if you haven't memorized, when you come across a zettel you'll read the full card and organically think of new thoughts that relate to it based on some other information you've read. 

*Atomic*: Generalizable ideas are where breakthroughs come from. Being able to truly explain the essence of an idea or proof demonstrates mastery of the topic and increases its usefulness because now you can try to apply that model of thinking to other topics. This means we should write notes so we can understand even after forgetting exact original context. 

*Quick, reliable feedback*: Feynman: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€“ and you are the easiest person to fool." We need accurate and quick feedback to keep us motivated and to accurately depict our current level of understanding. One way to achieve this is to use the following method for learning: write fleeting notes in a common notebook, then rewrite the important notes while keeping track of bibliographical information, and at the end of the day condensing the important ideas into zettels to insert into the Zettelkasten. The key point is to paraphrase information in your own words at each step: multiple passes makes it more likely we'll catch ourselves when we're bullshitting understanding. Making the Zettelkasten the final step ensures that only the truly important ideas we can explain ourselves are inserted. 

*Backed up*: The problem with a physical system is that we can't easily back up our work. One solution is to append another step to the process stated above: once a month, go through the Zettelkasten and write up an article of ideas from one big cluster within the Zettelkasten.
