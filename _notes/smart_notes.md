Taking notes is the invisible medium which allows great writing. Few notice that taking notes is something that can be improved because, unlike the finished written product, there is rarely any feedback for the quality of notes. 

There is no correlation between academic success and a high IQ (at least not north of 120). Rather, the most important predictor of success seems to be strong discipline when approaching one's daily work. Trying to achieve strong discipline through willpower is a losing battle; studies indicate willpower is depleted quickly and has little potential for improvement. Luckily, if we can make a task interesting, meaningful, and well-defined, we won't *need* willpower to achieve discipline to complete the task. Taking notes are key to achieving this criteria. Put another way, taking smart notes is what makes a lot of academic endeavors possible. 

Success isn't the result of strong willpower but rather the result of smart working conditions to avoid resistance in the first place. 

Luhmann used two slip-boxes. After reading something, Luhmann wrote the bibliographic information on one side of an index card along with notes on the other side. He put this in the first slip-box, the bibliographic slip-box. Then, after he finished reading, he looked at his bibliographic notes and wrote his own thoughts on another index card. He only wrote on one side for this step so it would be easier to read the cards without removing them from the slip-box.

I need to really give this a shot because I'm 95% sure this will be the way to self-learn stuff and also 99% sure I'll struggle for the first month or so with it. Stick with it! 

**The 4 main principles**

1. Focusing on writing as if nothing else matters does not mean that you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend lecture, or read, or listen to a conversation will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus. Don't waste time wondering about what you "should" learn. Rather, try to learn as efficiently as possible. 

2. With the usual systems, the question is: under which topic do I store this note? With this system, the question is: in which context will I want to stumble upon it again? Don't sort notes by semester or class! That's stupid; it's like storing purchases by date. Where did you buy your pants from? Maybe it'll be with the bleach or oranges. Rather, put it with the other pant purchases. The problem with categories is that you will probably not know if a note is fleeting, permanent, or part of some project note. This system solves this. You shouldn't worry about the category of note because you cannot know what category it belongs to. Rather just insert the note into the slip-box; if it's important you'll have more notes close to it eventually, and if it's not important, it'll get lost by itself. This allows you to build a critical mass of notes and allows the system to become better as it becomes larger. Notice that most other systems get crowded with too many notes that you forget how to move around it. 


**Workflow**

Start with a notebook. When reading or trying to learn something, paraphrase what you want to learn in the notebook. 

Then, process these paper notes into Zotero as a bullet-point list under the source. Don't copy the handwritten notes exactly but try to paraphrase and simplify once more. 

Finally, at the end of the day, go through the lists in Zotero. For each idea: think about how it is related to other notes in the Zettelkasten and then create an atomic card with the essence of the idea and links to other notes.
