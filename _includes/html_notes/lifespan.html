<p>We've been able to successfully clone several different animals in recent years. The fact that most cloned animals live normal lifespans provides strong evidence against the "aging is caused by mutations" theory. Old animals shouldn't be able to clone new ones if they aged <em>by losing crucial genetic information</em>. If that theory of aging was true, all clones would be the same age as their "parent." Older animals must retain the genetic information to create a younger, healthier version of themselves. </p>
<p>About a decade ago, scientists began to agree that aging is caused by many different factors. </p>
<p>Stem cells, if harnessed correctly, have the potential to mitigate many of these factors. We've been making ground on the rates of rates of acceptance for bone marrow transplants, which is a common method of infusing stem cells. </p>
<p>But we don't really have an explanation of <em>why</em> these hallmarks cause aging? Could there be something deeper of which the hallmarks are only a byproduct? </p>
<p>The author believes aging is due to a deterioration of the epigenome, which is kdjf </p>
<p>Epigenetic information is stored in chromatin, unlike genetic information which is stored in DNA. The epigenome is crucial to any complex organism; it controls the way cells interact with each other (make more precise). </p>
<p>"If the genome were a computer, the epigenome would be the software." Without the epigenome, neurons could decide one day to turn into a skin cell. </p>
<p>But the epigenome is analog information, and its storage naturally degrades over time. To reverse aging, the author believes we need to recover and maintain the epigenome. </p>
<p>We know of at least 24 "longevity genes" that can extend lifespans. Based on food, exercise, time of day, and more, these genes choose when to tell our cells to repair and when to reproduce. </p>
<p>The author works with sirtuins, which are longevity genes found in nearly every cell. Sirtuin is based on the yeast SIR2 gene, which was the first longevity gene to be discovered. "Sirtuins are enzymes that remove acetyl tags from histones and other proteins and change the packaging of the DNA, turning genes off and on when needed... They have evolved to require a molecule called NAD... the loss of NAD as we age, and the resulting decrease in sirtuin activity, is thought to be a primary reason our bodies develop diseases when we are old but not when we are young." </p>
<p>Two other similar longevity genes are mTOR and AMPK. Sirtuin, mTOR, and AMPK have proven easy to control. We can trigger these longevity genes without actually putting our lives in danger (discussed later). </p>
