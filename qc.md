# Quantum Computing 

### Useful Links 
- Jeremy Kun's [introduction to quantum computing](https://jeremykun.com/2014/12/08/a-motivation-for-quantum-computing). 
- Lucien Hardy's [intuitive derivation of quantum mechanics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0101012.pdf). 
- My Linear Algebra [notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jj_jUxL1pDjReAikCL0u1XOhm8HZpcx2/view). 
- [Advice](http://www.mit.edu/~aram/advice/quantum.html) from someone more qualified. 

Nielsen and Chuang's *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* is a standard introductory text. I'm working on a solution set to the exercises [here](https://github.com/warrenalphonso/qc-latex/tree/master/nielsen-and-chuang-notes).
