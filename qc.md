# Quantum Computing

Nielsen and Chuang's *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* is a standard introductory text. I'm working on a solution set to the exercises [here](https://github.com/warrenalphonso/qc-latex/tree/master/nielsen-and-chuang-notes). 

My reflections on some topics in the field. In an attempt to develop intuition, I've created these to keep track of the various rabbit holes I went down to try learn.

"For the most part the way we understand quantum computing today is at an ENIAC-like level, looking at the nuts-and-bolts of qubits and logic gates and linear algebra, and wondering what the higher-level understanding may be." - Quantum computing for the very curious 

"What the Hadamard and similar gates do is expand the range of operations that it’s possible for a computer to perform. That expansion makes it possible for the computer to take shortcuts, as the computer “moves” in a way that’s not possible in a conventional classical computer. And, we hope, that may enable us to solve some computational problems faster." - QCFTVC
