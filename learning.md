# Experimental Learning

This is a barebones, vivid account of the *surprising* answers to the question: "What's the best way to learn something?" In the hopes of not creating a summary of information found elsewhere, I'm restricting myself to methods I actually tried out. 

Use the websites in "On Writing" to figure out how to write this post well. I really want this to be as condensed as possible because I know there's a lot I'll need to add in terms of examples and more information from the books. 

I tend to collapse back into the state of doing this for the sake of doing it. I'm never going to write anything interesting if I don't spend time thinking deeply about a topic. I keep opening this out of boredom and then closing it not even 5 minutes later. **Sit down and think.** Noticing when I'm not focused and self-correcting is important because learning requires deliberate thinking. 

## Remembering Books 

I remember very little of what I read. Usually if I come across a book on my shelf that I remember enjoying, I'll reread it because I usually won't be able to remember why I enjoyed it so much. Rereading is fine, but maybe there's a better way to retain information from books. 

### First Principles 

My method for reading efficiently is a reaction to the idea that reading isn't always a good thing: it can be a waste of time and actively bad. Then, we'll try to develop our method of reading to combat these traps. 

#### Reading isn't Intrinsically Good 

Reading is just tracing in pen what the author has already written in pencil. There is no learning being done because there is no independent thinking occuring. Reading then can make you stupid: if you continuously let someone else think for you, you forget how to think yourself. {% annotate Most of this section is based on ["On Books and Reading"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Books_and_Reading) by Arthur Schopenhauer. I recommend it highly. %} If reading is leisurely and pleasing, then you're probably not thinking very hard. Most authors write superfluously to better explain themselves (hence the popular addage about books being too long). Find some other way to think so deeply that reading becomes arduous. 

Reading a lot means that you're less likely to remember what you've read. Your brain is being overwritten continuously. 

Assume that the vast majority of books were written only to make money. Most of these are not worth your time. Never read a book because it is popular - ignore political, religious, or contemporary works. Bad books are intellectual poison; they destroy the mind. To read what is good, one must make it a condition never to read what is bad. 

Popular books are popular with the foolish majority. Refuse these and seek the books written by the rarest of minds, of all times and countries. Read only books written by people who live *for* science or poetry. There will rarely be more than a dozen great book per century. Read these many times over and avoid the others. 

People are quick to read works about great thinkers but rarely read the works of great thinkers. This is because it is easier to let someone modern take over your thinking than it is to work hard at translating an ancient's thoughts. Refuse this compromise at all costs. Read *Essays* by Montaigne not *A Life of Montaigne* by Bakewell. 

Immediately read an important book twice. You can only really understand the beginning after you know the end. Your mood will be different the second time through so you'll even pick up a different perspecitve. 

#### Reading as a Conversation

A common strategy for increasing comprehension is to take notes while reading. Making reading an active process by forcing myself to think about what to write prevents zoning off. My way of approaching this is to think of reading as having a conversation with the author. I can't talk to them but writing my thoughts in the margins gets pretty close. I've found that really adopting this mindset makes carving out time for reading easier. Few things are more worth doing than getting the chance to *talk* to a dead genius: why watch TV when I can probe Feynman's mind? {% annotate "Adults don't respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they did, they wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead." - Harry Potter, [HPMOR: Chapter 6](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/6) %}

This also provides a heuristic for when to discard boring books: if the author is a boring conversationalist and not saying anything new, stop listening. Giving up on books is somewhat controversial but given I'm trying to make this habit stick, reading only what's most interesting seems like a good idea. {% annotate I like Patrick Collison's [explanation of why to prioritize good books](https://fs.blog/2018/05/patrick-collison): "there's a set of great books that are really worth reading, and there's a subset of those books that are really enjoyable to read... the intersection of really worth reading and really enjoyable... is actually still more books than you can read in a lifetime." %}

Here's my current thought process on deciding what to read: **make a flow chart with what Patrick Collison said and add stuff**, the distiilled knowledge from most books can be garnered from other books so there's no reason to force yourself to read a book you hate. If bored, understanding diminishes anyway.

#### Taking Notes 

Having a notebook for books doesn't work because I need flexibility in the amount of space per book since I'm planning on rereading good books several times. Tablets/laptops aren't good because I can get distracted by looking stuff up from a book and don't trust myself to stay focused. Soltuion 1 is just individual pieces of paper so I can add more when I run out and neeed more space. 

Get a sheet of binder paper for each book. Underline stuff I think is interesting and jot down at least a sentence in the margins for each phrase I underline. After each chapter, convert stuff I want to remember from margins to sheet of paper and do my best to summarize the chapter if the bullet points don't cover everything. If I finish the book, it better be a really good book, so after finishing reading, come back in a week, go through notes on paper, then reread the book and add to notes. 

### Increasing Reading Speed and Comprehension

Pace: If you read 30 pages a day, you read 10,000 pages a year. However, if you're not diligent in note-taking, this can cause you to miss the point of many big books. Sometimes, reading well requires cancelling your plans to stay in and read. 

Is reading faster bad? Does it always come at the cost of comprehension? Is this even worth thinking about before testing?

Everytime I do this procedure {% annotate This procedure is from ["Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes"](https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning) by Tim Ferriss. %}, write down my results. I need to do it regularly and have goals to hit. 

**Key Goals**: 
1. Minimize the number and duration of fixations per line. Reading left to right doesn't result in a continuous movement of the eye but a series of jumps. Usually, each fixation lasts about 1/4 of a second. 
2. Reduce back-skipping. People normally spend about 30% of reading time on subconscious rereading. 
3. Increase horizontal peripheral vision and number of words processed per fixation. Untrained readers miss out on 50% of words per fixation because they don't use their peripheral vision. 

Practice the following at 3x your desired reading speed. 

**The Procedure**: 

Baseline: Figure out the average number of words per page. Read normally for exactly 1 minute and determine baseline words-per-minute. 

Trackers and Pacers: We can achieve all our key goals by using a tracker and pacer. Hold a pen in your dominant hand and underline each word with the cap on, ensuring your eyes follow the tip of the pen. 

1. Without regard for comprehension, read for 2 minutes using the pen, keeping each line to a maximum of 1 second. Increase the speed with each subsequent page. 
2. Repeat the above for 3 minutes, reading 2 lines in a maximum of 1 second. This is an exercise. Give it your full attention and don't daydream. 

Perceptual Expansion: Training peripheral vision can result in a 300% increase in speed. 

1. For 1 minute, read each line starting with the second word, and ending on the second-to-last. Stay on each line for 1 second at most. 
2. Repeat the above, but start and end each line three words from the margin. 
3. Reapeat the above for 3 minutes now, starting and ending each line four words from the margin. Read 2 lines in 1 second.

*Don't worry if you don't comprehend anything!* We are trying to condition ourselves and you want to be at three times your desired speed anyway. 

Calculate New Speed: Read for 1 minute and determine new words-per-minute. 


### Thought Experiments on Book Takeaways 

Imagine a world where I hadn't read this book - how different would it be? Imagine my life if I hadn't read this book - how different would it be? What's the most I could make of applying this book to my life?

Watch the TED talk about how IQ increase is based on imaginative thinking. 

### Mind Mapping Books 

Take out a blank sheet before starting a book, write everything you know about the subject, and after every reading sessions take a few minutes to add to the map. Periodically review the map.
