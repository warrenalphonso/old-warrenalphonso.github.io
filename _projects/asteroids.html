            The 1979 Atari arcade space shooter game Asteroids, recreated in Javascript. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, there is a neural network built without using any frameworks that can be trained to play. 
        </p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In order to manually play, run asteroids.html in your browser and make sure to turn the `AUTOMATION_ON` constant to `false`.
            Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the ship. Use the up arrow key to move forward, and hit spacebar to shoot.
        </p>
        <p>
            To train a neural network to play, turn `AUTOMATION_ON` to `true`. You can change `NUM_SAMPLES` to vary training iterations and 
            `OUTPUT_THRESHHOLD` to change the necessary accuracy in order for the spaceship to commit to a turn.
        </p>
